## Configuration

### 1. Tor Setup

The application requires Tor for dark web functionality. You can either:

**Option A: Use Tor Browser (Recommended for beginners)**
- Download and install Tor Browser
- Start Tor Browser before running F-OSINT DWv1

**Option B: Run Tor as a service**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo systemctl start tor
sudo systemctl enable tor

# macOS
brew services start tor
```

### 2. Application Configuration

Configuration files are located in the `config/` directory:

- `settings.json`: Main application settings
- `tor_config.txt`: Tor-specific configuration

You can modify these files to customize the application behavior.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tor Connection Failed**
```
Solution: Ensure Tor is running on localhost:9050
Check: sudo systemctl status tor
```

**PyQt5 Import Error**
```
Solution: Install Qt5 development packages
Ubuntu: sudo apt install python3-pyqt5-dev
```

**Permission Denied Errors**
```
Solution: Run with appropriate permissions
Check: chmod +x src/main.py
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting environment variable:
```bash
export FOSINT_DEBUG=1
python src/main.py
```

## Security Considerations

### Operational Security (OpSec)

1. **Use VPN**: Consider using VPN in addition to Tor
2. **Isolated Environment**: Run in virtual machine when possible
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep all dependencies updated
4. **Data Handling**: Securely store and dispose of sensitive data

### Legal Compliance

- Ensure compliance with local laws and regulations
- Obtain proper authorization before investigating targets
- Respect terms of service of external services
- Use only for legitimate security research and education

## API Integration

F-OSINT DWv1 supports integration with external APIs:

- **Have I Been Pwned**: Breach checking (API key required)
- **VirusTotal**: File and URL analysis (API key optional)
- **Shodan**: Network device discovery (API key optional)

Configure API keys in `config/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "apis": {
    "haveibeenpwned": "your-api-key",
    "virustotal": "your-api-key",
    "shodan": "your-api-key"
  }
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### System Tuning

1. **Increase RAM**: More RAM allows for larger datasets
2. **SSD Storage**: Faster disk I/O improves performance
3. **Network Bandwidth**: Higher bandwidth for faster data collection

### Application Tuning

1. **Adjust Rate Limits**: Modify request rates in settings
2. **Optimize Database**: Regular cleanup of old data
3. **Monitor Resources**: Use system monitoring tools

Important directories to backup:
- `data/`: User accounts and projects
- `config/`: Application configuration
- `reports/`: Generated reports

### Automated Backup

Create backup script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
tar -czf "fosint_backup_$DATE.tar.gz" data/ config/ reports/
```
